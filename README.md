# Supermariobros-Agent-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
This project develops a machine learning model for creating agents that can complete stages in Mario Bros using Reinforcement Learning and the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm. 
This project involves the environment and agents obtained from the Open Ai Gym library, and the use of the PPO algorithm using the Stable Baselines 3 Library. 
The result is an agent that can take action based on the rewards obtained so that the agent will maximize the rewards as much as possible. 
The metric used in testing this model is the evaluate policy available in the stable baselines library which calculates the average reward amount. 
The development of this model is still not very good, due to computing limitations on my personal device, but the amount of training can be increased if necessary.

## Limitation
This model is only trained using 10,000 steps, which is almost equivalent to 10 iterations

This is my personal project made by Winaldi Putra Juya
